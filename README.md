# Qabus Tower Website
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnhPv8DTr0o
#### Description:
This is a website specially designed to guide tourists around Qabus Tower area.
This website basically offers various information about the Tower itself and its city "Gonbad e Kavous".
They can also see pictures of the tower in its gallery or even call emergency services in case they're not familiar with the phone numbers.
The best feature that this project contains is that anyone can see where they are by scanning the QR codes installed in front of Northern, Western and Southern gates of the tower block.
I have used two common frameworks on this project.
First one is React.js and the second one is Sanity.io
I have also included many useful libraries onto React.js such as axios, daytimejs, react-router-dom and etc.
  
  ### How to run the script?
  #### React.js
  Well there are two folders inside Final Project directory. Build and Dist folders.
  Build is meant to contain contents of React.js. 
  
  (**npm start** | localhost:3000)
  #### Sanity.io
  Dist contains Sanity.io folders. 
  
  (**sanity start** | localhost:3333)
  
  Unfortunately, the access to Sanity.io's panel is restricted to only me. You can contact me via **dralpaynamazi@gmail.com** if you'd like to add more images to website's gallery.
  There is no other credentials needed to run the website.
